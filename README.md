# deberia
Deberia pulls from pop culture to create a different sort of magic eight ball experience. You should try it. 

Simple Web App that uses Angular.js as front-end framework and calls a randomized image and message based on user input. 

It had a very short development timeframe, just one day, so bugs are sure to exist. If you find any, let me know !

I was in charge of development of this tiny app. Design and the whole idea came from the team over at [Elede Lab](http://elede.milohaus.com), while I worked there.
