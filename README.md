Deberia pulls from pop culture to create a different sort of magic eight ball experience. You should try it. 

Simple Web App that uses Angular.js as front-end framework and calls a randomized image and message based on user input. 

I was in charge of development of this tiny app. Design and the whole idea came from the team over at [Elede Lab](http://eledelab.co)
